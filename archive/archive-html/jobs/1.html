            At Google, we are building the most complete cloud ecosystem in
            Europe. To this end, we rely first and foremost on a crystal-clear,
            quality user experience. We don’t want our users getting lost in
            complex interfaces. We believe there is no technical challenge that
            can’t be transformed into a smooth and friendly experience for our
            clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            We aim to make the user experience design a pillar of the cloud
            industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reporting to our Design Ops, you’ll work closely with all the
            Product Designers, Visual Designers, and Front-end Developers, to
            ensure the best quality of our design system.
